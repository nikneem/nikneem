# Hey Hi!

My name is Eduard Keilholz, I'm a software developer, mostly using Microsoft Technologies. My passion is to work with the Azure cloud and even more <âš¡> Azure Functions <âš¡>.

I like to help organizations move their systems to the cloud, making sure the system fits their needs and is ready for the future. In my spare time I try to learn new techniques and systems I can use. You can read my findings [in my blog](https://hexmaster.nl).

Feel free to reach out and/or connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ed_dotnet) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikneem/). In case you use one of my code samples, please drop a message. I love to know how you like it or if I can make changes to make it even better ðŸ˜„
